Audiovisual Display Of Average Temperature In Vienna Since 1873

You are about to experience an audiovisual representation of data.
The underlying data comprises the average temperature per year in Vienna since 1873.
You will observe a sphere and hear various sounds.
The sphere will become bigger and brighter red as the average temperature per year increases.
The primary sound features a polyphonic synthesizer, which will become louder as the average temperature rises.
Additionally, the filter will open or close in response to the temperature.
As a third feature, for every 0.5째C above the lowest measured temperature, a new note will be added to the chord.
When the temperature is 2째C above the lowest measured temperature, a highpass filtered noise will be included.
At 3째C above the lowest measured temperature, a lowpass filtered noise will be introduced.
If the temperature exceeds 4째C above the lowest measured temperature, a synthesized kickdrum will be added.
To initiate the audiovisual display of the data, you must first activate the audio in your browser by clicking the "activate audio" button.
Afterwards, you can simply start and stop the display by using the corresponding buttons.
Furthermore, you have the option to select a desired timeframe for inspection, adjust the animation speed, choose different waveforms for the main synthesizer
and the scale from which the notes for the chord are selected.
